Title of the Project: MTS BANK

Explanation and Overview of the project: MTS BANK IS AN ONLINE BANK WHICH IMPLEMENTS A MONEY TRANSFER SYSTEM. USERS CAN LOG IN TO THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS OR REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT. USERS CAN VIEW THEIR CHECKINGS & SAVINGS ACCOUNT BALANCES AND TRANSFER MONEY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. USERS CAN VIEW ALL TRANSACTIONS. USERS CAN VIEW STATEMENTS BY CHOOSING A SELECTION FROM A LIST. THE LIST INCLUDES CURRENT MONTH, LAST MONTH, LAST 3 MONTHS, AND TOP 10 TRANSACTIONS. USERS CAN DOWNLOAD A TXT, PDF, OR XLSX FILE FOR EACH STATEMENT.

List of features implemented: USERS CAN LOG IN OR REGISTER WITH INVALID INFORMATION FOR THE BANK, USERS CAN VIEW EACH PAGE AND VIEW HARD-WRITTEN BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS/STATEMENTS NOT WITHIN A DATABASE. USERS CAN CLICK ON ALL BUTTONS, LINKS, AND NAVBAR TABS WITH SOME BUT NOT ALL FUNCTIONALITY. USERS CANNOT MAKE TRANSFERS. USERS CAN GET SOME OF THE TXT, PDF, OR XLSX FILES IN THE CONSOLE BUT CANNOT VIEW THEM IN THE BROWSER WINDOW OR DOWNLOAD THEM WHEN CLICKING ON THE LINKS. IN THE NEAR FUTURE I WOULD LIKE TO GET ALL FUNCTIONLAITY (EXPLAINED IN THE OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT) WORKING PROPERLY FOR THE MONEY TRANSFER SYSTEM.

Technologies used: HTML, Maven, Git, Hibernate, JavaScript, Javalin, AWS S3, AWS EC2, Java
